1) Makefile:
For Eg:
a)
all: library.cpp main.cpp
 $@ evaluates to all                        => Name of the file being generated[Normally]
 $< evaluates to library.cpp                => First prereq
 $^ evaluates to library.cpp main.cpp       
b) .PHONY: A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file. It is just a name for some commands 
to be executed when you make an explicit request. There are two reasons to use a phony target: 
- to avoid a conflict with a file of the same name, and 
- to improve performance.
Eg: .PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -r -f *.o
